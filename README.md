# Ruby Exercises – THP (Week 2, Day 3)

This repository contains several small Ruby programs developed during **Week 2, Day 3** of the Ruby curriculum at **The Hacking Project (THP)**.

The goal of these exercises is to practice Ruby fundamentals such as:
- methods
- conditionals
- loops
- user input
- basic program structure

## File Structure

All the Ruby programs are located in the `lib/` directory:

- `00_hello.rb`  
  A simple introductory program focusing on basic input/output.

- `01_pyramids.rb`  
  An exercise involving loops and conditional logic to display different pyramid shapes.

- `02_password.rb`  
  A program centered around user input, verification, and simple authentication logic.

- `03_stairway.rb`  
  A **text-based game** that simulates a stair-climbing challenge.

## About the Stairway Game

The last program (`03_stairway.rb`) is intentionally more playful.  
It is a small **text-based game** where:

- A dice is rolled (random number between 1 and 6)
- Depending on the result, the player moves forward, backward, or stays on the same step
- The objective is to reach the top of the stairway

This program is especially fun because it includes **humorous comments and jokes written in French**, which makes the game more entertaining when played in the terminal.

## Context

These programs were written as part of the learning process at **The Hacking Project**, a peer-learning coding school focused on practical programming skills and autonomy.

They are educational exercises and are not intended for production use.
